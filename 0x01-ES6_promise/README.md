# 0x01. ES6 Promises

## Promises are a way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous task and allow you to write code that is easier to read and maintain.

## To create a Promise, you use the new Promise() constructor and pass a function (often referred to as an executor) with two arguments: resolve and reject. Inside the executor function, you perform the asynchronous operation and call resolve when it is successful or reject if it encounters an error.
