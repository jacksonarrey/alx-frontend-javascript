# 0x00. ES6 Basics

## ES6: ES6 stands for ECMAScript 6, which is a newer version of the JavaScript programming language. It's like a set of rules that tell computers how to understand and run JavaScript code. ES6 introduced some new features to make programming in JavaScript easier and more powerful.

New features introduced in ES6: In ES6, there were several new features added to JavaScript. Some of them include:

Arrow functions: These are a shorter way to write functions in JavaScript.
Constants and variables: Constants are values that cannot be changed, while variables are values that can be changed.
Block-scoped variables: These are variables that are only accessible within a specific block of code, like inside a loop or a function.
Rest and spread parameters: These allow you to work with multiple values as a group, either by combining them or splitting them apart.
String templating: This feature allows you to easily create strings by combining variables and text.
